SOLID stands for:

- S = Single-responsiblity Principle
- O = Open-closed Principle
- L = Liskov Substitution Principle
- I = Interface Segregation Principle
- D = Dependency Inversion Principle

--------------------------------------------------------------
First Type Single-Responsibility Principle

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Open-Closed Principle
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
